Plastic chocks are much cheaper and lighter-weight, but not nearly as durable as rubber. If you have a very heavy fifth wheel, motorhome, etc... It's probably a good idea to use rubber

Most people who use the X-style use them in combination with the wedge style. The advantage of X-style is added stability (less back and forth rocking), whereas wedge chocks are generally much cheaper
