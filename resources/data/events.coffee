This is it, the RV event of the year! Itâ€™s the World Series, Oscar night, and the Met Gala all rolled into one. Itâ€™s New Yearâ€™s Eve for 7 nights, itâ€™s Christmas meets Chanukah. Itâ€™s like payday and your tax refund landed on the same day. Itâ€™s the thing people will be talking about for the next year. Itâ€™s the 5th Xscapers Annual Bash!

The Xscapers Annual Bash is back at our rodeo grounds home in Lake Havasu City Arizona. Come join us for the social event of the RVersâ€™ year. Over 600 working-age RVers from all walks of life will descend on the edge of the Colorado River for a week of excitement, entertainment, education, games, fun, romance, and new and old friendships!

If youâ€™ve never been to an Xscapers Annual Bash, youâ€™ll be shocked! This ainâ€™t your grandmaâ€™s RV rally! The days are filled with speakers covering all topics RV and RV life related including boondocking, solar, working on the road, cooking, and hobbies. The evenings are filled with a mobile party like youâ€™ve never seen at an RV event. Dance the night away at a rave, sing out loud to classic rock and 80s bands, compete in fun games, or participate in margarita contests. Join in the theme nights and hang out by the fire till sunrise. Try craft brews, share your favorite guacamole recipe, or just try one of the dozens on offer. Indulge in local food trucks, share drinks and ideas with like minded RVers, and be part of a movement! Get out of your rig, and get to living at the Xscapers Annual Bash!
